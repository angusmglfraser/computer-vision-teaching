		<h1>Canny Edge Detection</h1>
		<p>The Canny edge detector is a slightly more advanced approach to edge detection. It employs a few different techniques to
			try and minimise the level of noise in an image. The steps are as follows: </p>
		<div>
			<div>
				<h2>Blurring</h2>
				<p>The first step in the canny edge detector is to blur the image. This helps to smooth out noise and small variations in
					textured areas, while still preserving strong edges. This example uses a gaussian blur, but other implementations of
					this edge detector often use other blurring techniques such as mean blurs, or box blurs. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Basic Edge Detection</h2>
				<p>The second step is to perform some basic edge detection, usually using the Sobel operator. The edge gradients in the
					x and y directions are stored and used in later calculations</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Computing Edge Angles & Edge Thinning</h2>
				<p>In this step, only local maxima in edge intensity are preserved. This serves to reduce thicker edges down to the point
					at which the change in intensity is greatest. To do this, first the edge angles are computed, and then rounded to the
					nearest increment of 45 degrees. Since the two convolutions with the sobel operator give edge intensity in both the
					x and y directions, the angle of an edge at any specific pixel can be calculated using the following formula:</p>

				\(\theta = atan2(G_x, G_y) \)

				<p>Where \( G \) is the intensity of the edge in the x or y direction.</p>

				<p>This value is then assigned a value of 0, 45 or 90 degrees. 0 if the line is closest to the vertical axis, 90 if it is
					closest to the horizontal axis and 45 if it is closest to one of the diagonals. There is no distinction made between
					the two diagonals in this case because the sobel operator gives the same response for edges on one diagonal as it does
					on the other. </p>

				<p>To finish edge thinning, each pixel that is a local maximum in it's assigned direction (i.e. if it's edge gradient is
					greater than it's neighbours in the specified direction) is preserved for the next step, and the rest are discarded. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Thresholding</h2>
				<p>The Canny edge detector uses two thresholds to designate each pixel as a strong edge, a weak edge, or a non-edge. All
					values above the upper threshold are assigned as strong edges. Of the remaining values, those above the lower threshold
					are assigned as weak edges, and the rest of the values (those below the lower threshold) are non-edges, and are discarded.
					The pixels marked as weak edges will become strong edges or will be discarded in the next step. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Hysteresis</h2>
				<p>In this step, weak edges are either included in the output or discarded. As mentioned before, strong edges are automatically
					included. Each weak edge is included in the output if it has at least one neighbouring pixel that is a strong edge.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>The two thresholds should in most cases be quite close to each other. The lower threshold should normally be at a point
			where there are few or no false positives, but there are also gaps in locations where there should be edges, while the
			upper threshold should be at a point where there are no false negatives, but false positives start to show up. The precise
			value of these thresholds has to be determined empirically, since different lighting conditions, the textures of surfaces
			in a scene and many other factors will affect the amount of noise in an image. </p>
